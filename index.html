                <h3>World Cup - 2022</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Lionel Messi</b>’s journey to winning the 2022 World Cup is a story of dreams, struggles, and
                    unshakable determination. For years, he carried the hopes of Argentina on his shoulders, facing
                    heartbreaking losses along the way. In 2014, he came close but lost in the final, and earlier
                    defeats in the Copa América only added to his pain. At one point, the weight of failure made him
                    step away from international football. But Messi didn’t give up. Instead, he returned stronger,
                    driven by the belief that success was still within reach.

                    In 2022, his perseverance paid off. Messi led Argentina with skill, passion, and unmatched
                    determination, scoring crucial goals and inspiring his team every step of the way. In the dramatic
                    final against <b>France</b>, he proved why he is one of the greatest, scoring <b>twice</b> and holding his nerve
                    in the penalty shootout. When he finally lifted the World Cup, it wasn’t just a trophy - it was proof
                    that hard work, patience, and never giving up can turn any dream into reality.
